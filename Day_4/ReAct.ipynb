The relationship between workplace automation and labor productivity growth in the context of AI-induced job displacement risks is critical to understanding the broader impact of AI on labor markets. This dual nature of AI's impact is further supported by Nica et al., 2023a, Nica et al., 2023b and Lăzăroiu and Rogalska (2023), who analyze the integration of AI in workplace tracking systems and the resulting labor productivity growth.

Corporate Accountability: Companies that deploy AI technologies have an ethical responsibility to consider the broader impact of job displacement. Retraining and Education: Displaced workers often lack access to the training and education necessary to transition to new jobs in the AI-driven economy. Addressing the ethical implications of AI-induced job displacement requires a multi-faceted approach that involves governments, businesses, educational institutions, and society. The ethical implications of AI and job displacement are complex and multifaceted. Ultimately, addressing the ethical implications of AI and job displacement requires a collaborative effort involving policymakers, businesses, labor unions, and civil society.\n",
